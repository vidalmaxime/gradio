# Upcoming Release

## New Features:

### New `gr.BarPlot` component! üìä

Create interactive bar plots from a high-level interface with `gr.BarPlot`. 
No need to remember matplotlib syntax anymore!

Example usage:

```python
import gradio as gr
import pandas as pd

simple = pd.DataFrame({
    'a': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I'],
    'b': [28, 55, 43, 91, 81, 53, 19, 87, 52]
})

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.BarPlot(
        simple,
        x="a",
        y="b",
        title="Simple Bar Plot with made up data",
        tooltip=['a', 'b'],
    )

demo.launch()
```

# Version 3.18.0

## New Features:

### Revamped Stop Button for Interfaces üõë

If your Interface function is a generator, there used to be a separate `Stop` button displayed next
to the `Submit` button.

We've revamed the `Submit` button so that it turns into a `Stop` button during the generation process.
Clicking on the `Stop` button will cancel the generation and turn it back to a `Submit` button. 
The `Stop` button will automatically turn back to a `Submit` button at the end of the generation if you don't use it!

By [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 3124](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/3124) 


### Queue now works with reload mode!

You can now call `queue` on your `demo` outside of the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block and
run the script in reload mode with the `gradio` command. 

Any changes to the `app.py` file will be reflected in the webpage automatically and the queue will work
properly!

  file_directories=["/var/lib/demo/path/to/resources"]

# Version 3.14.0

## New Features:

### Add Waveform Visual Support to Audio
Adds a `gr.make_waveform()` function that creates a waveform video by combining an audio and an optional background image by [@dawoodkhan82](http://github.com/dawoodkhan82) and [@aliabid94](http://github.com/aliabid94) in [PR 2706](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2706. Helpful for making audio outputs much more shareable.

### Allows Every Component to Accept an `every` Parameter

When a component's initial value is a function, the `every` parameter re-runs the function every `every` seconds. By [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs) in [PR 2806](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2806). Here's a code example:

Replaces tunneling logic based on ssh port-forwarding to that based on `frp` by [XciD](https://github.com/XciD) and [Wauplin](https://github.com/Wauplin) in [PR 2509](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2509)

You don't need to do anything differently, but when you set `share=True` in `launch()`,
you'll get this message and a public link that look a little bit different:

```bash
Setting up a public link... we have recently upgraded the way public links are generated. If you encounter any problems, please downgrade to gradio version 3.13.0
.

# Version 3.13.0

## New Features:

### Scatter plot component

It is now possible to create a scatter plot natively in Gradio!

The `gr.ScatterPlot` component accepts a pandas dataframe and some optional configuration parameters
and will automatically create a plot for you!

This is the first of many native plotting components in Gradio!

For an example of how to use `gr.ScatterPlot` see below:

```python
import gradio as gr
from vega_datasets import data

cars = data.cars()

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.ScatterPlot(show_label=False,
                   value=cars,
                   x="Horsepower",
                   y="Miles_per_Gallon",
                   color="Origin",
                   tooltip="Name",
                   title="Car Data",
                   y_title="Miles per Gallon",
                   color_legend_title="Origin of Car").style(container=False)

demo.launch()
```

<img width="404" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41651716/206737726-4c4da5f0-dee8-4f0a-b1e1-e2b75c4638e9.png">


By [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 2764](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2764)


### Support for altair plots

The `Plot` component can now accept altair plots as values!
Simply return an altair plot from your event listener and gradio will display it in the front-end.
See the example below:

```python
import gradio as gr
import altair as alt
from vega_datasets import data

cars = data.cars()
chart = (
    alt.Chart(cars)
    .mark_point()
    .encode(
        x="Horsepower",
        y="Miles_per_Gallon",
        color="Origin",
    )
)

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Plot(value=chart)
demo.launch()
```

<img width="1366" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41651716/204660697-f994316f-5ca7-4e8a-93bc-eb5e0d556c91.png">

By [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 2741](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2741)

### Set the background color of a Label component

The `Label` component now accepts a `color` argument by [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 2736](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2736).
The `color` argument should either be a valid css color name or hexadecimal string.
You can update the color with `gr.Label.update`!

This lets you create Alert and Warning boxes with the `Label` component. See below:

```python
import gradio as gr
import random

def update_color(value):
    if value < 0:
        # This is bad so use red
        return "#FF0000"
    elif 0 <= value <= 20:
        # Ok but pay attention (use orange)
        return "#ff9966"
    else:
        # Nothing to worry about
        return None

def update_value():
    choice = random.choice(['good', 'bad', 'so-so'])
    color = update_color(choice)
    return gr.Label.update(value=choice, color=color)


with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    label = gr.Label(value=-10)
    demo.load(lambda: update_value(), inputs=None, outputs=[label], every=1)
demo.queue().launch()
```

![label_bg_color_update](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41651716/204400372-80e53857-f26f-4a38-a1ae-1acadff75e89.gif)

# Version 3.12.0

## New Features:

### The `Chatbot` component now supports a subset of Markdown (including bold, italics, code, images)

You can now pass in some Markdown to the Chatbot component and it will show up,
meaning that you can pass in images as well! by [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs) in [PR 2731](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2731)

Here's a simple example that references a local image `lion.jpg` that is in the same
folder as the Python script:

```py
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Chatbot([("hi", "hello **abubakar**"), ("![](/file=lion.jpg)", "cool pic")])

demo.launch()
```

![Alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1778297/204357455-5c1a4002-eee7-479d-9a1e-ba2c12522723.png)

To see a more realistic example, see the new demo `/demo/chatbot_multimodal/run.py`.

```python
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Accordion(label="Open for greeting", open=False) as accordion:
        gr.Textbox("Hello!")
    open_btn = gr.Button(value="Open Accordion")
    close_btn = gr.Button(value="Close Accordion")
    open_btn.click(
        lambda: gr.Accordion.update(open=True, label="Open Accordion"),
        inputs=None,
        outputs=[accordion],
    )
    close_btn.click(

# Version 3.11.0

## New Features:

### Upload Button
There is now a new component called the `UploadButton` which is a file upload component but in button form! You can also specify what file types it should accept in the form of a list (ex: `image`, `video`, `audio`, `text`, or generic `file`). Added by [@dawoodkhan82](https://github.com/dawoodkhan82) in [PR 2591](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2591).

Example of how it can be used:

```python
import gradio as gr

def upload_file(files):
    file_paths = [file.name for file in files]
    return file_paths

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    file_output = gr.File()
    upload_button = gr.UploadButton("Click to Upload a File", file_types=["image", "video"], file_count="multiple")
    upload_button.upload(upload_file, upload_button, file_output)

demo.launch()
```
### Revamped API documentation page

New API Docs page with in-browser playground and updated aesthetics. [@gary149](https://github.com/gary149) in [PR 2652](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2652)

### Revamped Login page

Previously our login page had its own CSS, had no dark mode, and had an ugly json message on the wrong credentials. Made the page more aesthetically consistent, added dark mode support, and a nicer error message. [@aliabid94](https://github.com/aliabid94) in [PR 2684](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2684)

### Accessing the Requests Object Directly

You can now access the Request object directly in your Python function by [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs) in [PR 2641](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2641). This means that you can access request headers, the client IP address, and so on. In order to use it, add a parameter to your function and set its type hint to be `gr.Request`. Here's a simple example:

```py
import gradio as gr

def echo(name, request: gr.Request):
    if request:
        print("Request headers dictionary:", request.headers)
        print("IP address:", request.client.host)
    return name

io = gr.Interface(echo, "textbox", "textbox").launch()
```

## Bug Fixes:
* Fixed bug that limited files from being sent over websockets to 16MB. The new limit
is now 1GB  by [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs) in [PR 2709](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2709)

## Documentation Changes:
* Updated documentation for embedding Gradio demos on Spaces as web components by
[@julien-c](https://github.com/julien-c) in [PR 2698](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2698)
* Updated IFrames in Guides to use the host URL instead of the Space name to be consistent with the new method for embedding Spaces, by
[@julien-c](https://github.com/julien-c) in [PR 2692](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2692)
 * Colab buttons on every demo in the website! Just click open in colab, and run the demo there.

# Version 3.9

## New Features:
* Gradio is now embedded directly in colab without requiring the share link by [@aliabid94](https://github.com/aliabid94) in [PR 2455](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2455)

### Calling functions by api_name in loaded apps

When you load an upstream app with `gr.Blocks.load`, you can now specify which fn
to call with the `api_name` parameter.

```python
import gradio as gr
english_translator = gr.Blocks.load(name="spaces/gradio/english-translator")
german = english_translator("My name is Freddy", api_name='translate-to-german')
```

The `api_name` parameter will take precendence over the `fn_index` parameter.

# Version 3.8.2

## Bug Fixes:

* Ensure gradio apps embedded via spaces use the correct endpoint for predictions. [@pngwn](https://github.com/pngwn) in [PR 2567](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2567)
* Ensure gradio apps embedded via spaces use the correct websocket protocol. [@pngwn](https://github.com/pngwn) in [PR 2571](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2571)

## New Features:

### Running Events Continuously
Gradio now supports the ability to run an event continuously on a fixed schedule. To use this feature,
pass `every=# of seconds` to the event definition. This will run the event every given number of seconds!

This can be used to:
* Create live visualizations that show the most up to date data
* Refresh the state of the frontend automatically in response to changes in the backend

Here is an example of a live plot that refreshes every half second:
```python
import math
import gradio as gr
import plotly.express as px
import numpy as np


plot_end = 2 * math.pi


def get_plot(period=1):
    global plot_end
    x = np.arange(plot_end - 2 * math.pi, plot_end, 0.02)
    y = np.sin(2*math.pi*period * x)
    fig = px.line(x=x, y=y)
    plot_end += 2 * math.pi
    return fig


with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Row():
        with gr.Column():
            gr.Markdown("Change the value of the slider to automatically update the plot")
            period = gr.Slider(label="Period of plot", value=1, minimum=0, maximum=10, step=1)
            plot = gr.Plot(label="Plot (updates every half second)")

    dep = demo.load(get_plot, None, plot, every=0.5)
    period.change(get_plot, period, plot, every=0.5, cancels=[dep])

demo.queue().launch()
```

# Version 3.8

## New Features:
* Allows event listeners to accept a single dictionary as its argument, where the keys are the components and the values are the component values. This is set by passing the input components in the event listener as a set instead of a list. [@aliabid94](https://github.com/aliabid94) in [PR 2550](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2550)

# Version 3.7

## New Features:

### Batched Functions

Gradio now supports the ability to pass *batched* functions. Batched functions are just
functions which take in a list of inputs and return a list of predictions.

For example, here is a batched function that takes in two lists of inputs (a list of
words and a list of ints), and returns a list of trimmed words as output:

```py
import time

def trim_words(words, lens):
    trimmed_words = []
    time.sleep(5)
    for w, l in zip(words, lens):
        trimmed_words.append(w[:l])
    return [trimmed_words]
```

The advantage of using batched functions is that if you enable queuing, the Gradio
server can automatically *batch* incoming requests and process them in parallel,
potentially speeding up your demo. Here's what the Gradio code looks like (notice
the `batch=True` and `max_batch_size=16` -- both of these parameters can be passed
into event triggers or into the `Interface` class)

```py
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Row():
        word = gr.Textbox(label="word", value="abc")
        leng = gr.Number(label="leng", precision=0, value=1)
        output = gr.Textbox(label="Output")
    with gr.Row():
        run = gr.Button()

    event = run.click(trim_words, [word, leng], output, batch=True, max_batch_size=16)

demo.queue()
demo.launch()
```

In the example above, 16 requests could be processed in parallel (for a total inference
time of 5 seconds), instead of each request being processed separately (for a total
inference time of 80 seconds).

### Upload Event

`Video`, `Audio`, `Image`, and `File` components now support a `upload()` event that is triggered when a user uploads a file into any of these components.

Example usage:

```py
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Row():
        input_video = gr.Video()
        output_video = gr.Video()

     # Clears the output video when an input video is uploaded
    input_video.upload(lambda : None, None, output_video)
```

# Version 3.6

## New Features:

### Cancelling Running Events
Running events can be cancelled when other events are triggered! To test this feature, pass the `cancels` parameter to the event listener.
For this feature to work, the queue must be enabled.

![cancel_on_change_rl](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41651716/195952623-61a606bd-e82b-4e1a-802e-223154cb8727.gif)

Code:
```python
import time
import gradio as gr

def fake_diffusion(steps):
    for i in range(steps):
        time.sleep(1)
        yield str(i)

def long_prediction(*args, **kwargs):
    time.sleep(10)
    return 42


with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Row():
        with gr.Column():
            n = gr.Slider(1, 10, value=9, step=1, label="Number Steps")
            run = gr.Button()
            output = gr.Textbox(label="Iterative Output")
            stop = gr.Button(value="Stop Iterating")
        with gr.Column():
            prediction = gr.Number(label="Expensive Calculation")
            run_pred = gr.Button(value="Run Expensive Calculation")
        with gr.Column():
            cancel_on_change = gr.Textbox(label="Cancel Iteration and Expensive Calculation on Change")

    click_event = run.click(fake_diffusion, n, output)
    stop.click(fn=None, inputs=None, outputs=None, cancels=[click_event])
    pred_event = run_pred.click(fn=long_prediction, inputs=None, outputs=prediction)

    cancel_on_change.change(None, None, None, cancels=[click_event, pred_event])


demo.queue(concurrency_count=1, max_size=20).launch()
```

For interfaces, a stop button will be added automatically if the function uses a `yield` statement.

```python
import gradio as gr
import time

def iteration(steps):
    for i in range(steps):
       time.sleep(0.5)
       yield i

gr.Interface(iteration,
             inputs=gr.Slider(minimum=1, maximum=10, step=1, value=5),
             outputs=gr.Number()).queue().launch()
```

# Version 3.4

## New Features:

### 1. Gallery Captions üñºÔ∏è

You can now pass captions to images in the Gallery component. To do so you need to pass a {List} of (image, {str} caption) tuples. This is optional and the component also accepts just a list of the images.

Here's an example:

```python
import gradio as gr

images_with_captions = [
    ("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551969014-7d2c4cddf0b6", "Cheetah by David Groves"),
    ("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1546182990-dffeafbe841d", "Lion by Francesco"),
    ("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1561731216-c3a4d99437d5", "Tiger by Mike Marrah")
    ]

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Gallery(value=images_with_captions)

demo.launch()
```

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/192399521-7360b1a9-7ce0-443e-8e94-863a230a7dbe.gif" alt="gallery_captions" width="1000"/>

### 2. Type Values into the Slider üî¢

You can now type values directly on the Slider component! Here's what it looks like:

![type-slider](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/192399877-76b662a1-fede-4417-a932-fc15f0da7360.gif)

### 3. Better Sketching and Inpainting üé®

We've made a lot of changes to our Image component so that it can support better sketching and inpainting.

Now supports:
* A standalone black-and-white sketch
```python
import gradio as gr
demo = gr.Interface(lambda x: x, gr.Sketchpad(), gr.Image())
demo.launch()
```
![bw](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/192410264-b08632b5-7b2a-4f86-afb0-5760e7b474cf.gif)


* A standalone color sketch
```python
import gradio as gr
demo = gr.Interface(lambda x: x, gr.Paint(), gr.Image())
demo.launch()
```
![color-sketch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/192410500-3c8c3e64-a5fd-4df2-a991-f0a5cef93728.gif)


* An uploadable image with black-and-white or color sketching

```python
import gradio as gr
demo = gr.Interface(lambda x: x, gr.Image(source='upload', tool='color-sketch'), gr.Image()) # for black and white, tool = 'sketch'
demo.launch()
```
![sketch-new](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/192402422-e53cb7b6-024e-448c-87eb-d6a35a63c476.gif)


* Webcam with black-and-white or color sketching

```python
import gradio as gr
demo = gr.Interface(lambda x: x, gr.Image(source='webcam', tool='color-sketch'), gr.Image()) # for black and white, tool = 'sketch'
demo.launch()
```
![webcam-sketch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/192410820-0ffaf324-776e-4e1f-9de6-0fdbbf4940fa.gif)

# Version 3.3

## New Features:

### 1. Iterative Outputs ‚è≥

You can now create an iterative output simply by having your function return a generator!

Here's (part of) an example that was used to generate the interface below it. [See full code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1m9bWS6B82CT7bw-m4L6AJR8za7fEK7Ov?usp=sharing).

```python
def predict(steps, seed):
    generator = torch.manual_seed(seed)
    for i in range(1,steps):
        yield pipeline(generator=generator, num_inference_steps=i)["sample"][0]
```


![example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/189086273-f5e7087d-71fa-4158-90a9-08e84da0421c.mp4)

### 2. Accordion Layout üÜï

This version of Gradio introduces a new layout component to Blocks: the Accordion. Wrap your elements in a neat, expandable layout that allows users to toggle them as needed.

Usage: ([Read the docs](https://gradio.app/docs/#accordion))

```python
with gr.Accordion("open up"):
# components here
```

![accordion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/189088465-f0ffd7f0-fc6a-42dc-9249-11c5e1e0529b.gif)

### 3. Skops Integration üìà

Our new integration with [skops](https://huggingface.co/blog/skops) allows you to load tabular classification and regression models directly from the [hub](https://huggingface.co/models).

Here's a classification example showing how quick it is to set up an interface for a [model](https://huggingface.co/scikit-learn/tabular-playground).

```python
import gradio as gr
gr.Interface.load("models/scikit-learn/tabular-playground").launch()
```

# Version 3.2

## New Features:

### 1. Improvements to Queuing ü•á

We've implemented a brand new queuing system based on **web sockets** instead of HTTP long polling. Among other things, this allows us to manage queue sizes better on Hugging Face Spaces. There are also additional queue-related parameters you can add:

* Now supports concurrent workers (parallelization)
```python
demo = gr.Interface(...)
demo.queue(concurrency_count=3)
demo.launch()
```
* Configure a maximum queue size
```python
demo = gr.Interface(...)
demo.queue(max_size=100)
demo.launch()
```

* If a user closes their tab / browser, they leave the queue, which means the demo will run faster for everyone else

### 2. Fixes to Examples

* Dataframe examples will render properly, and look much clearer in the UI: (thanks to PR #2125)

![Screen Shot 2022-08-30 at 8 29 58 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/187586561-d915bafb-f968-4966-b9a2-ef41119692b2.png)

* Image and Video thumbnails are cropped to look neater and more uniform: (thanks to PR #2109)


![Screen Shot 2022-08-30 at 8 32 15 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/187586890-56e1e4f0-1b84-42d9-a82f-911772c41030.png)

* Other fixes in PR #2131 and #2064  make it easier to design and use Examples

### 3. Component Fixes üß±
* Specify the width and height of an image in its style tag (thanks to PR #2133)
```python
components.Image().style(height=260, width=300)
```
* Automatic conversion of videos so they are playable in the browser (thanks to PR #2003). Gradio will check if a video's format is playable  in the browser and, if it isn't, will automatically convert it to a format that is (mp4).
* Pass in a json filepath to the Label component (thanks to PR #2083)
* Randomize the default value of a Slider (thanks to PR #1935)

![slider-random](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/187596230-3db9697f-9f4d-42f5-9387-d77573513448.gif)


* Improvements to State in PR #2100

### 4. Ability to Randomize Input Sliders and Reload Data whenever the Page Loads
* In some cases, you want to be able to show a different set of input data to every user as they load the page app. For example, you might want to randomize the value of a "seed" `Slider` input. Or you might want to show a `Textbox` with the current date. We now supporting passing _functions_ as the default value in input components. When you pass in a function, it gets **re-evaluated** every time someone loads the demo, allowing you to reload / change data for different users.

Here's an example loading the current date time into an input Textbox:

```python
import gradio as gr
import datetime

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Textbox(datetime.datetime.now)

demo.launch()
```

Note that we don't evaluate the function -- `datetime.datetime.now()` -- we pass in the function itself to get this behavior -- `datetime.datetime.now`

Because randomizing the initial value of `Slider` is a common use case, we've added a `randomize` keyword argument you can use to randomize its initial value:

```python
import gradio as gr
demo = gr.Interface(lambda x:x, gr.Slider(0, 10, randomize=True), "number")
demo.launch()
```

# Version 3.1

## New Features:

### 1.  Embedding Demos on Any Website üíª

With PR #1444, Gradio is now distributed as a web component. This means demos can be natively embedded on websites. You'll just need to add two lines: one to load the gradio javascript, and one to link to the demos backend.

Here's a simple example that embeds the demo from a Hugging Face space:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://gradio.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3.0.18/gradio.js"></script>
<gradio-app space="abidlabs/pytorch-image-classifier"></gradio-app>
```

But you can also embed demos that are running anywhere, you just need to link the demo to `src` instead of `space`. In fact, all the demos on the gradio website are embedded this way:

<img width="1268" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-14 at 2 41 44 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/178997124-b2f05af2-c18f-4716-bf1b-cb971d012636.png">


Read more in the [Embedding Gradio Demos](https://gradio.app/embedding_gradio_demos) guide.

### 2. Reload Mode üë®‚Äçüíª

Reload mode helps developers create gradio demos faster by automatically reloading the demo whenever the code changes. It can support development on Python IDEs (VS Code, PyCharm, etc), the terminal, as well as Jupyter notebooks.

If your demo code is in a script named `app.py`, instead of running `python app.py` you can now run `gradio app.py` and that will launch the demo in reload mode:

```bash
Launching in reload mode on: http://127.0.0.1:7860 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
Watching...
WARNING: The --reload flag should not be used in production on Windows.
```

If you're working from a Jupyter or Colab Notebook, use these magic commands instead: `%load_ext gradio` when you import gradio, and `%%blocks` in the top of the cell with the demo code. Here's an example that shows how much faster the development becomes:

![Blocks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/178986488-ed378cc8-5141-4330-ba41-672b676863d0.gif)

### 3. Inpainting Support on `gr.Image()` üé®

We updated the Image component to add support for inpainting demos. It works by adding `tool="sketch"` as a parameter, that passes both an image and a sketchable mask to your prediction function.

Here's an example from the [LAMA space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/lama):

![FXApVlFVsAALSD-](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/178989479-549867c8-7fb0-436a-a97d-1e91c9f5e611.jpeg)

### 4. Markdown and HTML support in Dataframes üî¢

We upgraded the Dataframe component in PR #1684 to support rendering Markdown and HTML inside the cells.

This means you can build Dataframes that look like the following:

![image (8)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/178991233-41cb07a5-e7a3-433e-89b8-319bc78eb9c2.png)


### 5. `gr.Examples()` for Blocks üß±

We've added the `gr.Examples` component helper to allow you to add examples to any Blocks demo. This class is a wrapper over the `gr.Dataset` component.

<img width="1271" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-14 at 2 23 50 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/178992715-c8bc7550-bc3d-4ddc-9fcb-548c159cd153.png">


gr.Examples takes two required parameters:

- `examples` which takes in a nested list
-  `inputs` which takes in a component or list of components

You can read more in the [Examples docs](https://gradio.app/docs/#examples) or the [Adding Examples to your Demos guide](https://gradio.app/adding_examples_to_your_app/).

### 6. Fixes to Audio Streaming

With [PR 1828](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/1828) we now hide the status loading animation, as well as remove the echo in streaming. Check out the [stream_audio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/demo/stream_audio/run.py) demo for more or read through our [Real Time Speech Recognition](https://gradio.app/real_time_speech_recognition/) guide.

# Version 3.0

### üî• Gradio 3.0 is the biggest update to the library, ever.

## New Features:

### 1.  Blocks üß±

Blocks is a new, low-level API that allows you to have full control over the data flows and layout of your application. It allows you to build very complex, multi-step applications. For example, you might want to:

* Group together related demos as multiple tabs in one web app
* Change the layout of your demo instead of just having all of the inputs on the left and outputs on the right
* Have multi-step interfaces, in which the output of one model becomes the input to the next model, or have more flexible data flows in general
* Change a component's properties (for example, the choices in a Dropdown) or its visibility based on user input

Here's a simple example that creates the demo below it:

```python
import gradio as gr

def update(name):
    return f"Welcome to Gradio, {name}!"

demo = gr.Blocks()

with demo:
    gr.Markdown(
    """
    # Hello World!
    Start typing below to see the output.
    """)
    inp = gr.Textbox(placeholder="What is your name?")
    out = gr.Textbox()

    inp.change(fn=update,
               inputs=inp,
               outputs=out)

demo.launch()
```

### 2. Our Revamped Design üé®

We've upgraded our design across the entire library: from components, and layouts all the way to dark mode.

![kitchen_sink](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/168686333-7a6e3096-3e23-4309-abf2-5cd7736e0463.gif)


### 3. A New Website üíª

We've upgraded [gradio.app](https://gradio.app) to make it cleaner, faster and easier to use. Our docs now come with components and demos embedded directly on the page. So you can quickly get up to speed with what you're looking for.

![website](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/168687191-10d6a3bd-101f-423a-8193-48f47a5e077d.gif)


### 4. New Components: Model3D, Dataset, and More..

We've introduced a lot of new components in `3.0`, including `Model3D`, `Dataset`, `Markdown`, `Button` and `Gallery`. You can find all the components and play around with them [here](https://gradio.app/docs/#components).


![Model3d](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/168689062-6ad77151-8cc5-467d-916c-f7c78e52ec0c.gif)
